# Week-1
This project uses deep learning to classify waste as Organic or Recyclable. A CNN built with TensorFlow and Keras processes images, with OpenCV for preprocessing and Matplotlib for visualization. Data is organized in labeled folders. Run main.py after installing dependencies to preprocess, train, and classify waste efficiently.
## Dataset
The dataset is too large to include in the repository.  
Download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQmRpsPgaX-H5B5Ov7CaxPLeqH-9WoZR/view?usp=sharing).  
The dataset comes as a ZIP file. After downloading and extracting the ZIP file, place the files in the following structure:
