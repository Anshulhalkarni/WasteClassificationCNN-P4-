# Week-1
This project uses deep learning to classify waste as Organic or Recyclable. A CNN built with TensorFlow and Keras processes images, with OpenCV for preprocessing and Matplotlib for visualization. Data is organized in labeled folders. Run main.py after installing dependencies to preprocess, train, and classify waste efficiently.
