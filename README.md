# Week-1
This project uses deep learning to classify waste as Organic or Recyclable. A CNN built with TensorFlow and Keras processes images, with OpenCV for preprocessing and Matplotlib for visualization. Data is organized in labeled folders. Run main.py after installing dependencies to preprocess, train, and classify waste efficiently.
## Dataset
The dataset is too large to include in the repository.  
Download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQmRpsPgaX-H5B5Ov7CaxPLeqH-9WoZR/view?usp=sharing).  
The dataset comes as a ZIP file. After downloading and extracting the ZIP file, place the files in the following structure:

## Week 2 Updates Summary  

In **Week 2**, we have enhanced our deep learning model for waste classification by making significant updates to the **Week 1 code**. Below are the key improvements and additions:  

### 🚀 Data Visualization Enhancement  
- Introduced a **grid visualization** of random images from the dataset using `plt.subplot()`.  
- The images are randomly selected and labeled, helping us understand dataset variations.  

### 🏗️ CNN Model Architecture Expansion  
- Added a **third convolutional layer (128 filters)** to capture more complex image features.  
- Increased model depth to improve accuracy.  
- Implemented **Dropout layers (0.5 rate)** in the dense layers to prevent overfitting.  

### 📂 Training and Testing Generators  
- Used `ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_directory()` to dynamically load images from the dataset.  
- Ensured **RGB conversion** and maintained `224x224` resolution.  
- Configured `class_mode='categorical'` for multi-class classification.  

### 📊 Model Training & Validation  
- Trained the model for **10 epochs** using the `model.fit()` function.  
- Added `validation_data=test_generator` to track validation performance.  

### 🔜 Next Steps for Week 3  
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy and loss plots**.  
- Test model predictions on new images.  
- Optimize the architecture using **pretrained models like MobileNet or ResNet** for better accuracy.  
- Deploy the model for real-world applications.  

These updates refine our model, making it more robust for classifying waste efficiently. 🚀
